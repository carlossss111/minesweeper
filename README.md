# HTML Minesweeper
A purely HTML, CSS and JS site for desktop browsers. Created to learn the DOM model and get more comfortable with Javascript objects.

## JS Structure
It's a bit of a mess right now. Might fix it later might idk.
There is 3 main objects. 
-'grid', which handles changes in the grid.
-'gameController', which handles game-related inputs from the user, aswell as win/loss.
-'options', handles input on size and mine count.
